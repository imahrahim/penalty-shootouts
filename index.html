			<h1>Penalty Shoot-outs Sheer Luck? </h1>
			<p style="font-size: 14px">In football, a penalty shoot-out is the tensest way to determine the winner of a
				match. Both teams are
				given five shots. Whichever team converts more out of those five, wins.
				<br />
				<br />
				Many believe that the outcome of a penalty shootout is like a lottery win and that the winner only
				succeeds through pure luck. However, an average success rate of <strong>74.74%</strong> suggests that
				there are other
				factors at play.
				<br />
				<br />
				Discover the following scenario of a penalty shootout to find out what these factors
				are and how they accumulate. This animated football represents the likelyhood of a goal in this
				scenario.

				<div class="step">
					<p>A penalty is about to be taken and the spectators’ attention shifts to just one person, the
						player taking it.
						A shot from just eleven meters taken with speeds from 50 to 100 kph.
						Once the ball is kicked it needs less than two thirds of a second to cross the goal line.
						No human can react that quickly.<br />
						So, the keeper must make a choice. He must guess where the kicker will send the ball.
						He chooses…. right.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step">
					<p>You step up to the spot. You have not forgotten your teams last penalty shootout. It ended in a
						defeat. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="step">
					<p>As their best forward, they chose you to take the shot.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step">
					<p>At merely 20 years of age, you don't worry yourself too much. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="step">
					<p>But you’ve just recently won an award. You’re one of the most promising prospects in your country
						and even abroad. A lot of people now know your name. No pressure…</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step">
					<p>You're taking your team's first shot. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="step">
					<p>As you're preparing yourself for the kick, you can't help but notice the goalkeeper talking to
						the referee. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="step">
					<p>Your nerves on edge you try to block it all out and focus on your routine. But there’s no
						whistle. The referee isn’t happy with your ball placement on the penalty spot. You adjust it and
						start over.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step">
					<p>All eyes are now on you. You stand ready to take the shot. But still no whistle… </p>
				</div>
				<div class="step">
					<p>Finally, there's the signal! Just get it over with! </p>
				</div>
				<div class="step">
					<p>No time for experiments now. I must execute what I’ve done so many times in practice.
						I don’t dare look at the keeper.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step">
					<p>Top bin! Not a chance!</p>

			<p style="color:azure">In many ways may a penalty shootout be influenced, both on the keeper’s as well as
				the taker’s side.
				<br />
				<br />
				The keeper is at the short end of the stick. Precisely where one wants to be in this case.
				There is no shame in not saving a penalty.
				Everybody knows, the keeper is at a disadvantage.
				So, there is little pressure.
				<br />
				<br />
				All the pressure weighs on the taker, in the advantageous position.
				The taker must weigh risk and reward of where to aim the shot.
				Composure and confidence beat ability, which only rarely overcomes a doubtful mind.
			</p>
			<h2 style="color:azure"> <br /><br /> Can we therefore assume that the World Cup winner was not decided by
				pure luck? </h2>
			<p style="color:azure">If we consider the two teams and their line-up for this penalty shootout (including
				team history, position, age and status), it is clear that there is an advantage for the Argentine team.
				On average, Argentina had a <strong>77.46%</strong> chance of scoring, while France only had a
				<strong>74.58%</strong> chance of success.
